Arduino Fibonacci LED Blinker

---

Really simple, the led will stay on for the number of seconds of the current fibonacci number, so f(n) means the led will stay on for n seconds then switch off or Blink for 1 second before moving on.

The base case f(1) and f(2) have been defined and the rest is done by f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) .
